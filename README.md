## What is Kaja?
Kaja is a web application in development that aims to simplify planning for trips and outings. With Kaja, users can get a straightforward itinerary based on their interests, budget, and time. Unlike many existing travel apps that offer a wide array of options but leave the hard work of planning to the user, Kaja focuses on streamlining this process to make decision-making easier.

The app is intended for people who are traveling or simply looking for a day out with friends, family, or a significant other. It's especially useful for those who don't want to spend time sifting through endless options and would rather have a more straightforward set of choices. While there are other services that offer trip planning features, Kaja aims to differentiate itself by being more user-friendly and focused on reducing the planning burden. Our goal is to offer a tool that makes outing planning easier, with the potential for more advanced features in the future.

## Why "Kaja"?

So, why did we name the app "Kaja"? It's actually a nod to the Korean phrase for "Let's go," which pretty much sums up what we're all aboutâ€”getting you out the door and into new experiences. It's catchy, easy to remember, and it cuts right to the chase. Plus, it adds a bit of international flair, which we think is pretty cool. So next time you're itching to go on an adventure but don't know where to start, just remember "Kaja" and let us handle the planning part.
